# This program is offered for use with the Science Buddies project idea
# "How Easily Can Your Password Be Hacked?" which lets you explore the
# makeup of a good password. This program will help you understand some
# methods that people use to guess other people's passwords. To see detailed written
# instructions for this project, visit

# If you use this program, or a modified version of it, for a science project,
# make sure to credit Science Buddies. Using somebody else's code without giving
# them credit is plagiarism, just like if you copied their writing.
#
# You'll notice that several parts of the code have places where 
# print() functions have been turned into comments. You might want to uncomment
# these print statements when debugging your program (or add more of your own in
# other places), but they will make your program run slower. There are also many lines
# that pause the program using input() statements. This gives you a chance to read
# the output and understand how the program works. Once your program is
# working, you can comment out these print() and input() statements to make it run faster.

#Tell Python we want to use some functions it doesn't always use
import sys, time, hashlib
from array import *
